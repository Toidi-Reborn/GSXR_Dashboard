# GSXR_Dashboard
Custom GSXR Dashboard for Speed, RPM, Temps, ETC. 

********* I started this project mid/late 2018 knowing it would be a long journey to completion. This project is also worked on in my spare time so I do not see it being done quickly. The To-Do list is being updated as I complete and come up with new tasks with the motorcycle. *********

8/25/19 UPDATE: Unfortunately, one of the seals in front fork has worn out causing it to leak fork oil.  This is normal given the age and millage of my motorcycle.  If you are unfamiliar with this part, it is basically what connects the front tire to the rest of the bike. The fork is responsible for the bikes suspension and is very unsafe to drive while the fork is leaking.  In order to fix this, the bike had to been taken apart in such a way that I will not be able to use it for this project at this time so there will be a longer delay on progress here.
The idea behind this is to create a custom design and front end display for a Suzuki GSXR Motorcycle. Like a lot of motorcycles out on the road, there will also be lights added to the vehicle which will be controlled through the same screen.
